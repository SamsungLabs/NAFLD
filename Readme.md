# Research Abstract 

Background: Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parametric maps from radiofrequency (RF) data analysis provide liver tissue composition information. Deep learning algorithms may improve diagnostic performance of QUS for hepatic steatosis. 

Purpose: To evaluate a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) algorithm, using QUS parametric maps and B-mode images, for diagnosing hepatic steatosis using MRI-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) as the reference standard in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 

Materials and Methods: Participants with clinically suspected NAFLD were prospectively enrolled between July 2020 and June 2021. All participants underwent US examinations for RF data acquisition and MRI-PDFF. Using RF data analysis, two QUS parameters (tissue attenuation imaging [TAI] and tissue scatter-distribution imaging [TSI]) were measured. On B-mode images, hepatic steatosis was graded using visual score (none/mild/moderate/severe). Using B-mode images and two QUS parametric maps (TAI and TSI) as input data, the 2D-CNN algorithm estimated hepatic fat fraction (DL-USFF) as a percentage. The correlation between DL-USFF and MRI-PDFF was evaluated. The diagnostic performance of DL-USFF for diagnosing hepatic steatosis (MRI-PDFF ≥5%) was evaluated, and compared with those of TAI, TSI, and visual score.  

Results: Overall, 173 participants (mean age: 51.1±14.1 years; 96 men) were included, with 126 (72.8%) participants having hepatic steatosis (MRI-PDFF ≥5%). DL-USFF correlated strongly with MRI-PDFF (Pearson r=0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82–0.90; P<0.001). For diagnosing hepatic steatosis (MRI-PDFF ≥5%), DL-USFF yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93–0.99), which was significantly higher than those of TAI, TSI, and visual score (p=0.015, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), providing a sensitivity of 90.5% (95% CI: 84.0–95.0%) and a specificity of 91.5% (95% CI: 79.6–97.6%) at a cutoff value of 5.7%. 

Conclusion: A deep learning-based 2D-CNN algorithm using QUS parametric maps accurately
